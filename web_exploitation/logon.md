# Logon - 150 points

I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. [link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:6153)

Hints:

-  Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins?
- How does check the admin's password?

We're presented with a standard login form, and we can always login with any random credentials, but a flag won't be displayed.

The sourcecode also does not show anything interesting. Hence, what i did next was to intercept the HTTP request using burpsuite, and see the request. Intercepting the login process gave me the request below:

```sh
GET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: 2018shell1.picoctf.com:6153
Cache-Control: max-age=0

```

Changing the value of admin into True, logs us in as the admin
