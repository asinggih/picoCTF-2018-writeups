Amongst the web exploit challenges that I manage to solve, this particular problem is the most frustrating one. 
We were only given a form with 1 input box to type to answer the question. And the question was _"What is the answer ?"_. Wtf.

Proceeding without typing anything took me to the next page

The web page displayed the SQL query that was executed at the backend with whatever input i placed earlier. 
Hence, I tried again using the `' or '1'='1` trick.

And then what? So close. I consulted the Piazza forum before proceeding further. One of the hints from the forum mentioned that if the actual answer is included in the output of the query, it will display 'You are so close.'. 
Having that info, we can brute force it to get the answer. From my database class, I remembered that SQL has `LIKE` operation, where it will return fields containing the specified pattern. It was the perfect time to utilise it.
However, I didn't know how to implement it in this context, since I couldn't write another `SELECT` statement. 

After a lot of googling and reading about SQLi related materials, apparently the `UNION` function could be utilised to perform the SQLi. Basically, `UNION` function allows us to write another `SELECT` statement, and appends the result as the extra rows towards the result of the 1st `SELECT` statement. However, the result of the query after the `UNION` statement needs to have the same number of columns as the first part of the query.

Therefore, since the challenge displayed a full query of what's executed at the backend 

`SELECT * FROM answers where answer=......` 

I could just utilise the same query for the `UNION` part.
